      <p> The X86 Encoder Decoder (XED), is a software library (and
      associated headers) for encoding and decoding X86 (IA32 and
      Intel64) instructions. The decoder takes sequences of 1-15 bytes
      along with machine mode information and produces a data
      structure describing the opcode, operands, and flags. The
      encoder takes a similar data structure and produces a sequence
      of 1 to 15 bytes. Disassembly is essentially a printing pass on
        the data structure.

      <P> XED is the encoder/decoder used
      by <A HREF="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool">Pin</A>
      and
      the <A HREF="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-software-development-emulator">Intel&reg;
      Software Development Emulator (SDE)</A>.  XED is used by the
      <A HREF="http://people.csail.mit.edu/emer/papers/2002.02.computer.asim.pdf">ASIM
      performance
      model</A>, <A HREF="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/kim/docs/wish11zsim.pdf">ZSIM</A>,

      as well as in projects at McAfee, Wind River, and many other
      projects inside and outside Intel.

      <p> XED supports the notion of layers of instructions. As new
       instructions are made public, the associated layers are added
       to the tables of instructions in the "datafiles" subdirectory.

      <p> XED compiles with various compilers (GNU gcc, MSVS, Intel
      ICC/ICL and Clang) and is supported on various operating systems
      (Linux, Microsoft Window, Apple OS X, etc.).

      <p> The XED examples also include binary image readers for
       Windows PECOFF, ELF, and Mac OSX MACHO binary file formats (32b
       and 64b). These allow XED to be used as a simple
       disassembler. The XED disassembler supports 3 output formats:
       Intel, ATT SYSV, and a more detailed internal format describing
       all resources read and written. The XED command line tool
       example can be linked with libelf/libdwarf on Linux and with
       dbghelp.dll on Microsoft Windows to access symbol information
       in binaries.  The command line tool can also emit (graphviz)
       "dot" graphs to show register dependences between instructions.

      <p> When required, XED can be built without the encoder or
        the decoder to reduce the code/data footprint.  The
        code in the XED library is written in C and is partially
        generated from tables using python scripts at build time. XED
        is designed for embedding and has a minimal set of simple
        external dependencies. XED requires only 6 simple external
        library functions (like memcmp and memset). The libxed library
        makes no system calls and allocates no memory.  It is
        multithread-safe after one-time initialization of the tables.
